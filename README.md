# snowplow-datapipeline-on-ecs
Datapipeline using snowplow analytics on the AWS ecosystem; specifically ECS clusters.

The codebase is redacted from how it was actually provisioned, so wherever you see a YOUR_... that means you have to replace the values with your specific implementation. Also, because of the git large file size restriction the elastic search jar from snowplow has to be unziped before use.
